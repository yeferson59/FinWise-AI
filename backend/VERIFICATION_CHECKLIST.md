### API Endpoints
- [x] POST /api/v1/files/ocr/image-quality (quality assessment)
- [x] GET /api/v1/files/ocr/cache/stats (cache statistics)
- [x] POST /api/v1/files/ocr/cache/clear (cache management)
- [x] All endpoints tested and working

### Backward Compatibility
- [x] Existing code works without modifications
- [x] New features are opt-in
- [x] Default behavior unchanged
- [x] No breaking API changes

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### 1. Run Tests
```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_ocr_improvements.py -v
```
Expected: All 23 tests pass ✅

### 2. Check Existing Tests
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_services/test_intelligent_extraction.py -v
```
Expected: All existing tests pass ✅

### 3. Verify Imports
```bash
.venv/bin/python -c "from app.services import image_quality, ocr_cache, ocr_corrections; print('✅ All imports working')"
```
Expected: No import errors ✅

### 4. Test Quality Assessment
```python
from app.services.image_quality import assess_image_quality

# Test with any image
quality = assess_image_quality("path/to/image.jpg")
print(quality)
```
Expected: Quality metrics returned ✅

### 5. Test Caching
```python
from app.services import ocr_cache

stats = ocr_cache.get_cache_stats()
print(f"Cache files: {stats['total_files']}")
```
Expected: Stats returned without errors ✅

### 6. Test Corrections
```python
from app.services.ocr_corrections import correct_financial_text

text = "Total: S/ 1O0.5O"
corrected = correct_financial_text(text)
print(corrected)  # Should show: Total: $100.50
```
Expected: Corrections applied ✅

### 7. Test Full Pipeline
```python
from app.services.intelligent_extraction import extract_with_fallback
from app.ocr_config import DocumentType

text, metadata = extract_with_fallback(
    filepath="path/to/receipt.jpg",
    document_type=DocumentType.RECEIPT,
    use_cache=True
)
print(f"Extracted: {len(text)} characters")
print(f"Quality: {metadata['quality_assessment']}")
```
Expected: Text extracted with metadata ✅

## 🐛 Known Issues

None currently! 🎉

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cache not working
**Solution**: 
1. Check if `./cache/ocr/` directory exists
2. Verify write permissions
3. Check `use_cache=True` in function call

### Issue: Quality assessment too strict
**Solution**:
1. Review thresholds in `image_quality.py`
2. Adjust `MIN_BLUR_SCORE`, `MIN_CONTRAST`, etc.
3. Test with representative images

### Issue: Corrections too aggressive
**Solution**:
1. Review patterns in `ocr_corrections.py`
2. Adjust specific correction rules
3. Add document-type specific logic

### Issue: Cache growing too large
**Solution**:
1. Run `ocr_cache.clear_cache(max_age_days=3)`
2. Reduce cache expiration time
3. Set up automated cleanup cron job
