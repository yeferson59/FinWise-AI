## 🎯 Use Cases & Recommendations

### When to Use Standard Extraction
```python
text, meta = extract_with_fallback(file, use_cache=True)
```
- High-quality scans
- General documents
- Real-time processing needs
- Most common use case

### When to Use Advanced Extraction
```python
text, meta = extract_with_multiple_strategies(file)
```
- Critical documents (financial, legal)
- Poor quality images
- Rotated or tilted documents
- Maximum accuracy needed

### When to Use Parallel Processing
```python
text, meta = await extract_parallel_strategies(file)
```
- Maximum speed needed
- Batch processing
- Multi-core systems
- API endpoints

### When to Use Region Detection
```python
text, meta = extract_text_by_regions(file)
```
- Business cards
- Sparse forms
- Documents with large margins
- Speed-critical applications

### When to Use Incremental Processing
```python
text, meta = process_large_image_incrementally(file)
```
- High-resolution scans (>4000x4000)
- Large TIFF/PDF pages
- Memory-constrained environments
- Very large images (up to 10000x10000)
